 * have a `useEffect` hook and a rapidly changing value as a dependency. We use
 * this hook to make sure we're not hitting the backend with too many requests
 * for images or iframe previewsÂ - this would otherwise be a problem as the flow
 * is updated in real-time as the user drags the width/height sliders or types in
 * the title/subtitle input fields.
